## What is this?

This is a fun and interactive web project where you get to decide whether you want to go out on a date or not. The buttons are playful, and even the "No" button likes to play hide and seek! ðŸ˜„

## How it Works

- **Yes Button:** Click to express your excitement and move on to the next step!
- **No Button:** Hover or click to witness the magical dance of the elusive "No" button.
